<div id="what-is-the-central-limit-theorem" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the central limit theorem?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important concept in statistical inference. It gives us two primary insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a variable is normally distributed, the sampling distribution of a test statistic calculated from this variable will also be normally distributed.</p></li>
<li><p>If a variable’s distribution is non-normal or unknown, the sampling distribution of its test statistics approach normality as sample size increases.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="why-is-this-important" class="section level2">
<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
<p>Normality assumptions arise frequently in statistics and econometrics. Hypothesis testing relies on a normally distributed sampling distribution to allow us to know the likelihood of a particular test statistic occuring. General linear models require normally distributed residuals. Etc etc etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="whats-our-goal" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s our goal?</h2>
<p>Our goal here is to replicate the process of drawing repeated samples from a population with underlying non-normal distribution of our choosing, as a simplified version of this great stack overflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40307510/central-limit-theorem-in-r">post</a>.</p>
<p>We take <code>t</code> trials of size <code>n</code> and store them in a matrix, then calculate the mean of each trial (i.e. row) in a function as such:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sample.means &lt;- function(samps, t, n) {
  rowMeans(matrix(samps, nrow = t, ncol = n))
}</code></pre>
<p>On average, our underlying distribution will take on values of one 80% of the time and zero 20% of the time - quite far from normality.</p>
<p>After using <code>set.seed()</code> with an arbitrary number to ensure reproducibility, we define <code>t</code> and <code>n</code> with some “low” values. The <code>rbinom()</code> function will return random draws of 1 and 0 according to our defined probabilities, which we store in <code>samps</code>. Finally, we use our <code>sample.means</code> function above to calculate the average of each trial, for a total of <code>t</code> sample means.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1000)

t &lt;- 150
n &lt;- 50

samps &lt;- rbinom(t*n, size = 1, prob = .8)
samp.means &lt;- sample.means(samps, t, n)</code></pre>
<p>All that remains is to plot histograms of the underlying data <code>samps</code> and the sample means <code>samp.means</code>, and voila:
</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(plotly)

sample &lt;- qplot(samps, geom = &quot;histogram&quot;, bins = 30, main = &quot;&quot;)
sample_means &lt;- qplot(samp.means, geom = &quot;histogram&quot;, bins = 30, main = &quot;&quot;)

p1 &lt;- ggplotly(sample)
p2 &lt;- ggplotly(sample_means)

subplot(p1, p2)</code></pre>

<p>On the left the dummy appears as we expect, with around 20% of observations at 0 and about 80% at 1. The right hand side shows the distribution of sample means, which is a bit too skewed to be considered normal. As per the CLT, let’s ramp up the size of <code>t</code> &amp; <code>n</code> and see what happens.</p>
